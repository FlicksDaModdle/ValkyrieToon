If you want to assist and make a setup wizard(more setup than fest's shaders bc thats how the game is), pls do ^^)

## Disclaimer
This shader isn't meant to be 100% accurate - what I only aim for is to replicate the in-game looks to the best of my ability. Some calculations are exactly how the game does things, some are my own thrown into the mix.

While the shader is developed primarily for datamined assets, this repository does not endorse datamining in any way whatsoever and will never directly provide the assets nor tools in extracting from game files.
